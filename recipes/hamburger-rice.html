            <p>Hamburger rice is a humble dish, but it is also about as easy and delicious as a quick weeknight meal gets.
               As its name suggests, at its most basic it consists of ground beef, rice, and little more, which mean it cooks fast.
            </p>
            <p>It is one of the few thirty minute meals that <em>actually</em> takes about thirty minutes rather than an hour.
            </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup white rice</li>
                <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
                <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce(optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine rice with 2 cups of water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover with a tight-fitting lid, 
                    reduce heat to lowest setting, and cook for 15 minutes. Turn off heat and let sit, covered, an additional 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>While rice is cooking, saute beef in a medium skillet until browned. Pour off some fat if desired, 
                    but leave at least a bit in the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add butter to cooked rice and gently mix, then add desired amount of rice to the skillet with the beef. I usually use half the total cooked rice, 
                    saving the rest for another use, but you can use as much or as little as you like.</li>
                <li>Season with soy sauce if using. Otherwise salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ol>
